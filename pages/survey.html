            Imagine that you are asked for advice by an international governmental organization that needs to evaluate the costs and benefits of public projects with intergenerational consequences. In its analysis, the organisation uses a number-dampened welfare function as the social objective:
            $$
            W = \sum_{t = 0}^{+\infty} n_t^\beta u_t,
            $$
            where, in year \(t\), \(n_t\) is the number of people alive, and \(u_t\) is the representative utility level. The representative utility level can be the average utility in the population, or lower value that reflects inequalities. Parameter \(\beta \in [0, 1]\) determines the value of a larger population. If \(\beta = 0\), social welfare is the sum of utilities across time. If \(\beta = 1\), representative utility in each period is multiplied by population size.

            <div>
            The policymakers tell you that while this formulation does not capture all of the important complexities of population ethics, they seek your advice on how to calibrate \(\beta\). Your answers will therefore help to improve the current state of decision-making for public investments.

            <h3 class="text-xl mt-4 mb-1.5">Question 1</h3>
            Which distribution most accurately represents your beliefs on the most appropriate value for \(\beta\)&nbsp;?

            If all relevant experts of the subject answered this survey, which distribution would most accurately represent their answers to the previous question?
