            Imagine that you are asked for advice by an international governmental organization that needs to evaluate the costs and benefits of public projects with intergenerational consequences. In its analysis, the organisation considers that social welfare in year \(t\) is equal to:
            $$
            W_t = n_t^\beta \tilde u_t.
            $$
            Population size \(n_t\) can vary with time. Representative utility level \(\tilde u_t\) can be the average utility in the population, or a lower value, to reflect inequalities. Parameter \(\beta \in [0, 1]\) determines the value of a larger population. If \(\beta = 0\), social welfare is the sum of utilities across time. If \(\beta = 1\), representative utility in each period is multiplied by population size.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
            The policymakers tell you that while this formulation does not capture all of the important complexities of population ethics, they seek your advice on how to calibrate \(\beta\). Your answers will therefore help to improve the current state of decision-making for public investments.

                    This section presents you with five different scenarios. In each
                    scenario, you are asked to consider two civilizations that differ in
                    their size and in the well-being of their inhabitants—see the scale
                    below.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Let's assume a happiness scale ranging from -100 (extreme
                    unhappiness) to 0 (neutral) to +100 (extreme happiness).
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
                    <li>Someone on level 0 is in a neutral state that feels neither good nor
                    bad.</li>
                    <li>Someone on level -1 experiences a very mild form of unhappiness,
                    only slightly worse than being in a neutral state.</li>
                    <li>Someone on level +1 experiences a very mild form of happiness, only
                    slightly better than being in a neutral state.</li>
                    <li>Someone on level -100 experiences the absolute worst form of
                    suffering imaginable.</li>
                    <li>Someone on level +100 experiences the absolute best form of bliss
                    imaginable.</li>
                    <li>Someone on level -90 experiences an extremely strong form of
                    suffering, only slightly less bad than someone on level -100.</li>
                    <li>Someone on level +90 experiences an extremely strong form of
                    happiness, only slightly less good than someone on level +100.</li>
                    <li>Someone on level -50 experiences a moderately strong form of
                    suffering, half-way between the worst form ofsuffering and a neutral
                    state.</li>
                    <li>Someone on level +50 experiences a moderately strong form of
                    happiness, half-way between the best form of bliss and a neutral

                <p>
                    Please imagine that these civilizations would live in a world that
                    contains countless Earth-like planets that can easily be reached by
                    these people. All civilizations will never increase or decrease their
                    population size. That is, their population size will remain
                    constant.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Please also imagine that all civilizations are technologically very
                    advanced. They have developed perfect renewable energy technologies and
                    <b>don't harm the environment in any way, no matter how big they are</b>.
                    Overall, their existence is completely self-sustaining and in harmony
                    with their ecosystem. Thus, there are <b>no problems with resource
                    depletion, environmental degradation, overcrowdedness, or overpopulation</b> — not even for very large civilizations.
